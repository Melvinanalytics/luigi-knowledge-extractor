## üí° Best Practices

### Commit Messages
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Reference issues when applicable
- Follow conventional commit format

### Branch Naming
- `feature/description` for new features
- `bugfix/description` for bug fixes
- `deployment/platform` for deployment configs
- `hotfix/description` for urgent fixes

### Pull Request Workflow
1. Create feature branch
2. Make changes
3. Push to GitHub
4. Create pull request
5. Request review
6. Merge after approval

### Security
- Never commit sensitive tokens
- Use environment variables for secrets
- Review permissions regularly
- Use fine-grained tokens

## üîó Integration Examples

### Railway Deployment
```
"Create a railway.toml configuration file"
"Add environment variables for Railway deployment"
"Create GitHub Actions workflow for automatic deployment to Railway"
"Set up production database connection strings"
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
```
"Create GitHub Actions workflow for testing"
"Add deployment step to Railway after tests pass"
"Set up automatic dependency updates"
"Configure security scanning"
```

**Pro Tip:** Start commands with context like "In my luigi-extractor repository, ..." for clarity.

**Remember:** All operations respect your GitHub permissions and repository settings.
